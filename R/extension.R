#' Zarr extension support
#'
#' @description Many aspects of a Zarr array are implemented as extensions. More
#'   precisely, all core properties of a Zarr array except for its shape are
#'   defined as extension points, down to its data type. This class is the basic
#'   ancestor for extensions. It supports generation of the appropriate metadata
#'   for the extension, as well as processing in more specialized descendant
#'   classes.
#'
#'   Extensions can be nested. For instance, a sharding object contains one or
#'   more codecs, with both the sharding object and the codec being extension
#'   points.
