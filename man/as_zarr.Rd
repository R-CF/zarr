\title{Convert an R object into a Zarr object.}
\usage{
as_zarr(x, name = NULL, location = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The R object to convert into a Zarr object. Must be a vector, matrix
or array of a numeric or logical type.}

\item{name}{Optional. The name of the Zarr array to be created.}

\item{location}{Optional. If supplied, either an existing \link{zarr_group} in a
Zarr object, or a character string giving the location on a local file
system where to persist the data. If the argument is a \code{zarr_group},
argument \code{name} must be provided. If the argument gives the location for a
new Zarr store then the location must be writable by the calling code. As
per the Zarr specification, it is recommended to use a location that ends
in ".zarr" when providing a location for a new store. If argument \code{name} is
given then the Zarr array will be created in the root of the Zarr store
with that name. If the \code{name} argument is not given, a single-array Zarr
store will be cre?ated. If the \code{location} argument is not given, a Zarr
object is created in memory.}
}
\value{
If the \code{location} argument is a \code{zarr_group}, the same group is
returned. Otherwise, the Zarr object that is newly created, or an error if
the Zarr object could not be created.
}
\description{
This function creates a Zarr object from an R vector, matrix or array. The
Zarr object will be a single Zarr array, with default settings derived from
the R object (data type, shape). Data is chunked into chunks of length 100
(or less if the array is smaller) and compressed.
