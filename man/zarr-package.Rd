\title{zarr: Native and Extensible R Driver for 'Zarr'}
\description{
The 'Zarr' specification is widely used to build libraries for the storage and retrieval of n-dimensional array data from data stores ranging from local file systems to the cloud. This package is a native 'Zarr' implementation in R with support for all required features of 'Zarr' version 3. It is designed to be extensible such that new stores, codecs and extensions can be added easily.
