\title{zarr: Native and Extensible R Driver for Zarr}
\description{
Zarr is a widely used format for the storage and retrieval of n-dimensional array data from data stores ranging from local file systems to the cloud. This library is a native Zarr implementation in R with support for all required features of Zarr version 3. It is designed to be extensible such that new stores, codecs and extensions can be added easily.
