# zarr4R

`zarr4R` is a library to access Zarr stores using native R code.

This library implements a native R driver for `zarr` stores. It is
designed against the specification for Zarr version 3 but is retains
read access for version 2 Zarr stores.

Like Zarr itself, this library is modular and allows for additional
stores, codes and extensions to be added to this basic implementation.

This project is in the very early stages of development and is not yet
fit for any purpose whatsoever.
