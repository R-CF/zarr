# zarr

`zarr` is a package to access Zarr stores using native R code.

This package implements a native R driver for `zarr` stores. It is
designed against the specification for Zarr core version 3.

Like Zarr itself, this package is modular and allows for additional
stores, codes, transformers and extensions to be added to this basic
implementation.

This project is in the very early stages of development and is not yet
fit for any purpose whatsoever.
