# zarr: Native and Extensible R Driver for 'Zarr'

The 'Zarr' specification is widely used to build libraries for the
storage and retrieval of n-dimensional array data from data stores
ranging from local file systems to the cloud. This package is a native
'Zarr' implementation in R with support for all required features of
'Zarr' version 3. It is designed to be extensible such that new stores,
codecs and extensions can be added easily.
